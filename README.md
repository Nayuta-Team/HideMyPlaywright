## Warning

* **Only partially patched for Chromium**, which means even if you patch it, you won't be able to hide the automation features of `Firefox` and `Webkit`.

## Usage

Open the terminal in the folder where `.playwright` is located and run this command.

```batch

>python setup.py <your playwright root directory>

// When no arguments are provided, it will patch the `./.playwright` in the current directory by default
python setup.py

or
// Patch the `_/src/bin/Release/.playwright`
python setup.py _/src/bin/Release/.playwright
```
